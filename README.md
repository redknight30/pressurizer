destroyed pressurizer can rarely be found deep in the sea where the darkness begins.
These can be cooked into dry sponges, and then placed near a liquid to remove an area of it
They will hold the water away until they are removed.
This will cause them to become destroyed, so to use them again they have to be cooked. i well try to makit so you craft a pressurizer in sted. 

### How it works:
* pressurizers create a 9x9 area of air-like nodes that water can't flow through (checks for protection).
* If pressurizer have cleared more than 3 nodes of liquid, they become destroyed pressurizer.
* Removing a pressurizer or destroyed pressurizer will turn a 9x9 area of air-like nodes back into air, as long as they are not in the area of another pressurizer.
*(Air-like nodes can be removed in protection by removing a pressurizer outside the protection, they are not meant to be permanent)*
